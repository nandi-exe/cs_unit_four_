# IB Computer Science IA: Tech Manager

## Criteria A
### Problem Definition

My client is the head of the Tech Crew club at my school.

Tech Crew is a student-led organization responsible for all technical production services across campus events—from lighting and sound at prom to full-scale theatre performances. Recently, the club has had challenges managing multiple events simultaneously, each with its own unique requirements in terms of gear, scheduling, and space usage. 

The current system in place is entirely manual: Google Calendar & Forms for scheduling, and a group chat for coordination. As expected, this setup hasn’t scaled well. Students have been double-booked for different shows, ended up at the wrong locations due to miscommunication, and equipment like cables or lights have gone missing or unreported when damaged. 

To make matters more complicated, the team is composed of rotating volunteers with shifting availability and responsibilities. There’s no clean way to assign tasks, monitor participation, or record equipment usage history.
### Proposed Solution

Tech Crew needs a unified platform to manage task assignments, resource tracking, and scheduling—all in one place. To address this, I propose to develop an integrated application using Python, KivyMD, and SQLite. This application will centralize scheduling, inventory management, and team communication within a single user-friendly interface.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability, making it ideal for rapid development. Its extensive ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks adds to its versatility. I’ve chosen KivyMD for the front end because it offers a wide range of pre-built widgets and UI components that make it easy to build visually appealing and functional interfaces. KivyMD applications can also be deployed on Android and iOS, providing flexibility for future mobile versions of the app.

For data management, I’m using SQLite, a lightweight and self-contained database engine. It integrates seamlessly with Python and is well-suited for local storage. Using a database like SQLite allows for efficient data querying, better organization, and the potential to export data to other applications when needed.

Altogether, this tech stack provides a solid foundation for creating a streamlined solution that meets Tech Crew’s organizational needs—now and as the club grows.
